## Description
This repository contains my personal portfolio website, which showcases my resume, projects, skills, and a contact form. It's a React single-page application that demonstrates my proficiency in modern web development and SPA architecture. I applied Bootstrap for responsive design and crafted a minimalist theme for a clean and user-friendly interface.
